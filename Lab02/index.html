                              generated code and more importantly teamwork from home.</p>

                        <h4> Software Engineer Intern</h4>
                        <p> At Microsoft I worked entirely with React JS and implemented a Redux store to an internal
                              web app
                              which fetches Azure DevOps Data through its API, displays it, and facilitates actions to
                              the
                              user. My work was tied with the designing of new components and following a unified style
                              for
                              the experience on the webpage.</p>

                        <h4> Web Developer</h4>
                        <p> Joined Oneila as a Web Developer as a part time job during my studies. I’m helping in
                              maintaining
                              a
                              web application that informs on Covid-19 stats from Mexico. We used Vue, a java-script
                              framework
                              with

                        <h4> Web Developer</h4>
                        <p> Worked with Roborregos, my robotics team, in creating our public website. We developed it
                              with the
                              help of React. Since it was a project we started from zero, it was quite interesting see
                              all the
                              different inputs from the team. I helped in designing and shaping responsive components
                              for our
                              web
                              solution.

                              about computer vision which was the brain behind our autonomous soccer playing robots. I

                              in the
